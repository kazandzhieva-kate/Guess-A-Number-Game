## Game Description

**Guess A Number** is a simple guessing game where the user is supposed to guess the number that the computer has generated. Said number is between **1 and 100** at first, then which each **level** passed (or number guessed) the range expands by a 100 (100, 200, 300, etc.). The user inserts manually **the number of tries** he wishes to have for the certain round.

The computer will tell the user whether each of his guesses is **lower** or **higher** then the expected number each round. The game also asks the user if they would like to **continue**
 playing after each level passed.

The user may **terminate** the game at any point using the **"End"** command at the terminal.
